            <p><span class="style">The Boundary Waters</span> is a large area of federal land that has been set aside to preserve the wilderness. It is a sanctuary for animals and people a like. There are no perminate structures allowed and it is the closest thing we can get to in our civilized world to being alone and shut off. To me, it is the way I would like to spend my vacations. Although it can be alot of work it is the kind of envronment that really makes me feel like I belong.
